# Predicting-Generosity 📊

Welcome to the Predicting-Generosity project! This project involves building a binary classification model to predict generosity based on various socio-economic features.

## Explore the Project 👀 

The project uses machine learning techniques to analyze data and predict generosity levels. The dataset includes features like GDP per capita, social support, and life expectancy.

## Key Components 🎬

1. **Binary Classification:**
   - Implement a model to classify outcomes as 'yes' (1) or 'no' (0) based on input features.

2. **Data Features:**
   - The dataset includes features such as:
     - Country
     - Year
     - Life ladder
     - GDP per capita
     - Social support
     - Life expectancy
     - Freedom to make life choices
     - Generosity
     - Perceptions of corruption
     - Positive affect
     - Negative affect
     - Confidence in national government
     - Democratic quality
     - Delivery quality
     - Standard deviation of ladder by country-year
     - GINI index

3. **Model Implementation:**
   - Fit a neural network model to the training data to predict generosity levels.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Assess the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
